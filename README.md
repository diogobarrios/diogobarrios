- 👋 Hi, I’m @diogobarrios, Master in Math, Statistics and Computing. 
- My dissertation was to find (if possible) the factors that are contributing 
  for increasing cesarean section rate. I applied a PCA and create a logistic model.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science overall, but in near future a specialization in Machine Learning.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and I'm intermediate in R, know something about SQL and NOSQL(i.e.,MongoDB)

- 💞️ I’m looking to get some work as intern or junior, or eventually collaborate in some project which I will get experience faster than self taught.

- 📫 If you are interested! Sent mail diogobarrios22@gmail.com
